                    <p class = "up">AIM is an application that helps small businesses to spread the word around the community on their day-to-day offer, events and etc. The problem we aim to address with this application is more towards local businesses such local market, cafes and etc, where they sells fresh products in a daily basis and would like to sell them away at a cheaper price by the end of the day.This application would help these business owners to put out a notification in the suburb letting people know that they are clearing certain product at a very low cost before closing and people in that area would get a notification to alert them that their local business owners are clearing some stocks making people in the suburbs aware of these small discounts which could save them a whole lot of money in the future.</p><br>

                    <p class="up">The business owners are able to advertise their products more effectively by giving incentives for the users in the local area to come and buy their stock. It also makes advertising more effective for these smaller businesses as they do not need to spend nearly as much on advertising on other platforms.  It aims to appeal to this audience as an alternative to existing social media websites that focuses more on their surrounding community and benefits both the businesses and the customers by providing them with incentives to use the application rather than merely having a Facebook page that exists more as a communication platform between the user and business, or an advertisement in a   newspaper/magazine, which may not be as common of a platform used by younger generations. When a business owner decides to sell of their remaining products they will advertise their sale on their website and provide a QR Code for the users based on the various deals.

                    <p class="up">As soon as a business owner puts up their sale promotion on their website, the people in the local area will recieve a push notification on their phone screen. Once the user decides to swipe open the push notification they are able to see which local businesses company are selling their products at a discounted price. If the user wishes to go ahead and check out the store, all they have to do is show their QR Code to the local store and they will be able to purchase the product at the discounted price which they will automatically recieve once they open the push notification. However, if they do not want to go to the store and check it out they can either delete or ignore the push notification or they can share their QR Codes with either their friends or family.</p>
